# Pre-process Framework for Trajectory Datasets (highD dataset format)
This is a framework to pre-process trajectory datasets by grouping them based on Track ID or Frame. Here, we used the framework to convert custom trajectory datasets to highD dataset format.
The framework is tested on:
-NGSIM to highD format conversion.
-ExiD to highD format conversion.
